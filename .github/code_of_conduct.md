# Code of Conduct  

<!-- Remove redundant language -->
**Adapted from Code for America’s [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct/blob/master/README.md)**  

<!-- Make it an active voice/active statement -->
We aim to provide an inclusive and collaborative environment by guarding each person’s dignity and sense of security.

## Expectations
**The OpenOakland community expects that our members:**
<!--Reframe as positive actions-->
1. Maintain a professional environment
   - By behaving in a workplace appropriate way
2. Respect personal space
   - By discouraging hugs and other physical contact
   - By asking and receiving permission before making physical contact
3. Consider other's feelings
   - By thinking about how a statement could be hurtful to another person, before saying it

We may forbid anyone who violates these expectations from participating in OpenOakland activities, events, and digital forums.

## Toolbox
**We have put together a toolbox to grow the environment outlined above.**

- When interacting with other people:
  1. Presume the value of others
     - Differing ideas, skills, and contributions all play a crucial role in the operation of each project
  2. Endeavor to include technical and non-technical skill sets in your project
  3. Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak
- When starting and working on a project:
  1. Strive to build tools that are open for public use
  2. Encourage participation from all community members in planning, designing, and implementating civic tech
     - Especially consider those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process
  3. Nourish positive relationships with community partners, community members, and local government staff
     - Actively involve them in the decision making process.

## Anti-Harassment Policy
**Adapted from the [Geek Feminism wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy), created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.**

This policy is based on several other policies. These policies include the *Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy*, written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the *Con Anti-Harassment Project.* Theses policies were generalized and had supporting materials added by Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin. Additionally, many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism, and other groups contributed to this work.

**All OpenOakland network activities, events, and digital forums and their staff, presenters, and participants are held to the anti-harassment policy included below.**

*OpenOakland is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of staff, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any OpenOakland event or network activity, including talks. Anyone in violation of these policies may be expelled from OpenOakland network activities, events, and digital forums, at the discretion of the event organizer or forum administrator.*

*Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing language or action.* 

*If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from OpenOakland network activities, events, and digital forums.*

*If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff or forum administrator 
<!--There should be actual instructions on finding an organizor-->
immediately. You can contact them at [EVENT ORGANIZER/FORUM ADMINISTRATOR EMAIL AND PHONE NUMBER]. Event staff or forum administrators will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.  
If you cannot reach an event organizer or forum administrator and/or it is an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove yourself from the situation.* 

*You can also contact OpenOakland about harassment at safespace@openoakland.org and feel free to use the email template below. The OpenOakland Core Team acknowledges that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation due to the number of events and the fact that our team is not always present. However, we are hopeful that by providing these guidelines we are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an environment that is welcoming to all.*

*We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.*

## Image, Video, and Audio Recording Policy

**Opt-in Model**  
OpenOakland respects the privacy of its members and event attendees— both online and offline. To this end, recordings at OpenOakland events can only be captured with the consent of all subjects captured in the recording. This includes video, photographic, and audio recordings. 

**Name Tags**  
Consent may be given or denied through the use of colored name tags.  
- A *Blue* name tag means that the person is okay with their recording being taken and shared
- A *Red* name tag means that they are **not** okay with their recording being taken and shared

If name tags are not available, or the person is not wearing a name tag, anyone capturing these recordings must obtain the subject's verbal consent. Ideally, they will obtain consent before capturing any recording. However, they must obtain consent prior to publicizing that content.

**Events in Public Spaces**  
Even when events are held in public spaces where consent is not legally required, our opt-in policy still applies. Our goal is make everyone comfortable, not to merely comply with legal requirements.

**Official OpenOakland Recordings**  
Any OpenOakland member capturing images on behalf of OpenOakland must follow the opt-in policy. This includes capturing images, video, or audio that will be posted or used on official OpenOakland channels, websites, or social media accounts. 

OpenOakland may conduct photo shoots. These are pre-arranged events specifically for capturing images, video, or audio for the promotion of OpenOakland events or projects. In this instance, each "model" should provide consent by signing a written wavier. This waiver should stipulate that the recordings will only be used for OpenOakland promotions. The OpenOakland Communications leads have the discretion to use officially made recordings in promotional materials.

**Disciplinary Action**  
Any complaints could result in a take down of images on media channels. If repeated complaints are filed, OpenOakland steering committee members may take disciplinary action.
