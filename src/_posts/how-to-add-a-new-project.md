  1. Navigate to Projects &#8211;> Add New from Dashboard. This will take you to a form with Add New Project at the top.
  2. Enter title; this should simply be the name of the project.
  3. Check the URL (&#8220;permalink&#8221;) shown beneath the title. Usually it will be fine, but if it seems linguistically awkward or too long, edit it. This is important for good SEO. Keep in mind that the URL and the title are the only things that you generally never want to change, so get them right the first time.
  4. Enter a description of the project in the big textbox. No need to obsess over this; you can easily update it later.
  5. Below the description fill in the Project Lead&#8217;s name and email, and choose (or upload) her/his picture using the button. By default, the information for Open Oakland&#8217;s Development Director will be shown.
  6. Optionally, you can provide a web address (URL) for the project&#8217;s website, such as a GitHub repo.
  7. Below that, under Excerpt, add an short description to be shown on the Projects page. If you omit this, the first few words of the description will be used.
  8. In the sidebar to the right, under Skills, check one or more of the skills the project team is looking for (or don&#8217;t check any). You can also add a skill that is not yet listed.
  9. In the sidebar to the right, under Stages, add ONE of the following: Discovery, Design, Development, or Deploy
 10. In the sidebar to the right, under Statuses, add ONE of the following: Active, Dormant, or Completed
 11. In the sidebar to the right, under Impacts, check one or more areas that the project impacts. You can also add an impact area that is not yet listed.
 12. In the sidebar to the right, under Featured Image, upload an image or add one from the Media Library that can be used as a background image on the Projects page. Choose something that has a &#8220;landscape&#8221; aspect ratio for best results.
 13. Don&#8217;t worry about Post Relationship &#8211; Tasks yet. Eventually, tasks may be implemented as a feature associated with Projects.
 14. Hit &#8220;Publish&#8221; and get somebody to high-five you!
