OpenOakland bridges **technology** and **community** for a thriving and equitable Oakland.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  As part of the <a href="https://brigade.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code for America Brigade network</a>, we are a welcoming and inclusive volunteer group of developers, designers, data geeks, and citizen activists who use creative technology to solve civic and social problems.
