#### Definition of an Active Project

  * Active projects have demonstrated meaningful progress at 2 out of the last 3 demo nights.
  * Demo nights are the first Tuesday of every month.
  * Physical presence is not required.
  * Projects may: present remotely, record a presentation or post a publication (blog, etc).
  * Ask Hack Night Lead if you&#8217;d like to update in a different way. We&#8217;re open!
  * _**All projects must be Open Source and <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">licensed using the MIT open source license</a> to be considered an OpenOakland project.**_

#### Gaining Representation on the Steering Committee

  1. [Fill-out this form](https://docs.google.com/a/openoakland.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3suG0AKMGHRzTONDOvS2Ru2htLuremLe2ivlg7hpdbEm5XQ/viewform)
  2. The Steering Committee will vote to approve your project at its next meeting.Â Only a simple majority is needed to approve.
  3. If rejected, a rationale will be given and the team may reapply in 2 months.

#### Off-boarding Projects

  * Occasionally, the Hack Night Lead will recommend that the Steering Committee vote to remove projects from the active list if they have not met the active project requirements. A simple majority is needed to remove.
  * Once removed, the project will be removed from the OpenOakland website, lose Steering Committee representation and potentially lose OpenOakland resources if they are needed for active projects.
  * A project can reactivate at any time!

#### Role of the Hack Night Lead

  * Hack Night Lead is responsible for guiding projects through this process and supporting projects with resources they need to make progress.

### Infrequently Asked Questions&#8230;

&nbsp;

#### I have to do stuff? What gives?

  * As a community, we want to push each other to make small, frequent progress
  * The theory in implementing this policy is two-fold: 
      * Make the barrier for progress updates low
      * Ask for a high frequency of updates (monthly)

#### Can I opt out of the steering committee?

  * We hope you and your project will benefit from being part of the OpenOakland community.
  * In return, the community asks you to: 
      * Give time to help shape the future of OpenOakland
      * Give feedback so that OpenOakland continues to meet your needs
  * Right now, the Steering Committee is our mechanism for facilitating that.
  * So in short&#8230; no! But we&#8217;ve tried to make this a light lift: 
      * Any team member may represent your project
      * The representative can change over time if needed
