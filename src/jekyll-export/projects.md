  </div>
  
  <div class="col2">
    <strong>Our Backstory</strong>: The City of Oakland is in the process of<br /> expanding their medical cannabis licensing to include regulation for<br /> cultivation and manufacturing. As part of this activity, the City also<br /> codified an Equity Licensing Program to address barriers to participation in<br /> the industry for members of disenfranchised communities in Oakland. This<br /> program includes a provision for “equity business incubators” to support new<br /> businesses in the industry. Equity businesses in the pipeline will be<br /> important to regular applicants, because regular licenses will only be<br /> issued on a one-to-one basis with equity licenses during the initial phase<br /> of the program. The incubator opportunity is intended to help new<br /> enterprises overcome the barrier of securing commercial space by<br /> incentivizing more established businesses to agree to share their existing<br /> space for a minimum of three years. By partnering with an equity business, a<br /> regular applicant will be moved to the top of the list for the next<br /> available non-equity cannabis business license.</p> 
    
    <p>
      To support the Equity Licensing Program, OpenOakland is providing support to<br /> other volunteer technologists and cannabis entrepreneurs who are working<br /> with the City of Oakland’s City Administrator’s Office and the Department of<br /> Race and Equity to develop<br /> <a href="http://cannaequity.org/">CannaEquity.org</a>, an online<br /> “matchmaking” application that would assist interested equity and regular<br /> applicants to locate each other efficiently. Applicants would create online<br /> accounts to pre-screen for compatibility and control the pace of information<br /> sharing and relationship building needed for the formation of space-sharing<br /> relationships. Once built, the app will be maintained until the end of phase<br /> one of licensing. This date will be determined by the collection of cannabis<br /> tax revenue sufficient to launch the next phase of equity applicant support<br /> services (assumed to be within one year).

    <strong>Our Backstory</strong>: Thefifth annual CityCamp successfully took<br /> place on Saturday, March 25, 2017 at Oakland City Hall. CityCamp is an<br /> unstructured conference where municipal employees, civic leaders, technology<br /> folks, software developers, journalists, and engaged residents can meet and<br /> discuss the intersections of technology and local government—how innovative<br /> technology and data uses can improve civic engagement, increase efficiency<br /> and transparency, connect residents, and incubate the technology community<br /> in our city. Unconferences are not structured up-front; the agenda is<br /> completed on the day based on topics the attendees themselves suggest. This<br /> gives attendees control over the topics and discussion happening at the<br /> event, so residents can drive attention towards issues they think are most<br /> important.

    <strong>Our Backstory</strong>: Soft Story is a simple interactive map of potential soft-story buildings in Oakland. Soft-story buildings are multi-unit, wood-frame, residential buildings with a first story that lacks adequate strength or stiffness to prevent leaning or collapse in an earthquake. These buildings pose a safety risk to tenants and occupants, a financial risk to owners, and risk the recovery of the city and region. This data shows the results of a screening program for potential soft-story buildings in Oakland. In 2008 Oakland surveyed its multi-family buildings with five or more units, and in 2009 passed <a href="http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/22928.pdf">an ordinance</a> that required the owners of these buildings to complete a simple evaluation of the ground floor. This data shows the results of these screenings as of early 2013.

Track G allows spending to be seen<br /> by location, by program, and by school.

    <strong>Our Backstory</strong>: While gang signs and other graffiti are<br /> common to inner cities, East Oakland is suffering from a plague of illegal<br /> dumping—mostly from outside actors. Trash Talk is envisioned as a tool for<br /> help neighbors plan and execute cleanups and graffiti removal.The app will<br /> help neighbors report issues and work together with the Oakland City Public<br /> Works Agency to remove trash, dead animals, and other consequences of<br /> illegal dumping in East Oakland neighborhoods. Trash Talk will also<br /> eventually connect with the City&#8217;s existing tracking app,<br /> <a href="https://en.seeclickfix.com/oakland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SeeClickFix</a><br /> for tracking volunteer time.
