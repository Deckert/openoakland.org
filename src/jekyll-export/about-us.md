OpenOakland is a non-profit civic innovation organization that brings together coders, designers, data geeks, journalists, and city staff to collaborate on solutions to improve the lives of Oaklanders. We are part of Code for America’s Brigade program and hold frequent events for community, local government and tech folks to work together. Our focus is on both community technology and open government projects that we support through community partnerships and engaged volunteers.

Check out our current [projects](http://www.openoakland.org/browse-projects/). Then get involved by coming to our next [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/), every Tuesday, 6:30–9 p.m. at Oakland City Hall. We look forward to meeting you.

Our organization is led by an elected [steering committee](http://www.openoakland.org/steering-committee/) and [bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QR-fr1WnmXkZoVNmWnZ9drzfmaZoPkodEOx-PkExt94/). We are fiscally sponsored by Code for America, a 501(c)3 nonprofit.
