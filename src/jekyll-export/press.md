_December 20, 2014 &#8211; GovTech Today newsletter, Government Technology Magazine_

“Welcome to a special “Great Ideas” edition of our Saturday newsletter. Over the course of 2014, Govtech Today covered hundreds great deployments and cool new ideas. Here are some of our favorites.

**[Oakland App Sheds Light on Campaign Finance  
](http://www.govtech.com/data/Oakland-App-Sheds-Light-on-Campaign-Finance.html?utm_source=newsletter_editorial&utm_medium=saturday_edition&utm_campaign=GovTech_Today&elq=23c8f56ed8714e8cb6aa1fb314580d3f&elqCampaignId=10033)** _<span class="s1">August 28, 2014 &#8211; Gov Tech, Jason Shueh</span>_  
&#8220;…residents got a clearer picture of mayoral candidates’ finances in the November election with an open data-powered transparency tool. The Open Disclosure platform pulled public data from a number of sources to provide a simple and timely analysis of candidates’ financial filings and major donors.”

**[Volunteers hack technology to improve Oakland city government](http://kalw.org/post/volunteers-hack-technology-improve-oakland-city-government)**  
_March 18, 2014 &#8211; KALW Radio, Laura Flynn_ ([mp3](http://cpa.ds.npr.org/kalw/audio/2014/03/WEB.HackingOakland.mp3), 5:39)<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-126-2" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://cpa.ds.npr.org/kalw/audio/2014/03/WEB.HackingOakland.mp3?_=2" />

Though a lot of jargon is thrown around, some of the people here have no tech backgrounds at all, including Anna Mathai. “I just wanted to know more about Oakland politics and budget,” she says. “Just about government. And I just find this to be a good forum to, I think, help foster transparency and open government. But also get plugged into what&#8217;s happening where, and what&#8217;s going to happen with the next election, and other initiatives.”

[**Oakland&#8217;s Public Participation Route to Open Data Legislation**](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/10/29/oaklands-public-participation-route-to-open-data-legislation/ "legislation")  
_October 29, 2013 &#8211; The Sunlight Foundation, Rebecca Williams_  
&#8220;The Oakland public input process serves as an excellent example of the community&#8217;s role in generating open data policy, and an exemplar route to incorporating public perspectives into policy. &#8221;

_August 4, 2013 &#8211; The White House_  
&#8220;This is the heart of civic hacking for me: building new solutions and processes to replace broken ones, sharing our lessons and our successes and allowing others to benefit from our knowledge, failures, and shared technology.&#8221;

&#8220;Oaklanders have always had a fierce penchant for community organizing. But until very recently, &#8220;grassroots activism&#8221; didn&#8217;t exactly conjure up the image of a bunch of self-described data nerds with their laptops in tow talking about code. But venture out to Oakland City Hall on most Tuesdays nights and you&#8217;ll find Open Oakland, a group of self-described &#8220;civic hackers&#8221; intent on using government data and technology to create better ways of engaging citizens. &#8230;&#8221;

_April 30, 2013 &#8211; East Bay Express, Ellen Cushing_  
&#8220;a new project that aims to use data visualization to give average people the tools they need to understand — and, in turn, get involved with — Oakland&#8217;s budgeting process, just went live a few days ago (in beta at least) and [it&#8217;s pretty sweet](http://openbudgetoakland.org/).&#8221;

[**Oakland Gets a New Data Visualization Site for its Budget**](http://techpresident.com/news/23749/oakland-gets-new-data-visualization-site-its-budget "dataviz")  
_April 30, 2013 &#8211; TechPresident, Sarah Stirland_  
&#8220;The civic hacking group [OpenOakland](http://data.openoakland.org/) unveiled a new [budget visualization Web site called Open Budget Oakland](http://openbudgetoakland.org/) Wednesday. The site enables visitors to visualize total department expenditures, the details of spending within each department, and their sources of funding.&#8221;

_March 30, 2013 &#8211; Ars Technica, Cyrus Farivar_  
&#8220;City officials see CFA and other parallel hacktivist projects, like OpenOakland, as a welcome (and low-cost) effort to aid a city under strain. They don’t expect technology to solve all of the Oakland’s problems, but they believe it might alleviate a small portion of the city’s challenges.&#8221;

**[Early Fruits for International Open Data Day 2013](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/early-fruits-international-open-data-day-2013/4793 "Early Fruits for International Open Data Day 2013")**  
_2/25/2013 &#8211; Atlantic Cities, Emily Badger_  
&#8220;This past Saturday was International Open Data Day, and with it came hackathons hosted in dozens of cities on five continents all simultaneously tinkering with apps, visualizations, data catalogs and new standards built on the world’s growing trove of public data. Of course, put a bunch of mapping geeks and civic hackers in a room – many rooms, all over the world.&#8221;

**[OpenOakland to host community hackathon Feb. 23](http://oaklandlocal.com/article/open-oakland-holding-hackathon-february-23-0)**  
 _2/19/2013 &#8211; Oakland Local, Samuel Felsing_  
&#8220;In Oakland, community group OpenOakland, will host its own Open Data Day celebration. The event, dubbed a “hackathon,” will be held at the 81st Avenue Branch of the public library. All Oakland residents are encouraged to attend — with designers, coders, statisticians and city staff members being especially welcome.&#8221;

 _1/18/2013 &#8211; OaklandNorth, Adam Grossberg_  
&#8220;So far, Oakland Wiki’s only stated guidelines are that the wiki is free and anyone can edit it &#8230; OpenOakland has already hosted an <a href="http://oaklandnorth.net/2012/12/03/openoakland-brigade-encourages-collaboration-between-government-and-community-using-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“unconference” they dubbed CityCamp</a>, which brought city officials and residents together to talk about local issues, and <a href="http://oaklandnorth.net/2012/11/02/oaklanders-push-city-council-candidates-for-increased-government-transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put together an Open Government Pledge</a> that asked Oakland politicians to affirm their commitment to government transparency.&#8221;

_1/2/2013 &#8211; East Bay Express, Azeen Ghorayshi_  
&#8220;I think one of the biggest problems we&#8217;ve faced is that whenever government operates in a closed fashion, it just asks for and results in distrust and concern that government isn&#8217;t doing what it&#8217;s meant to be doing and isn&#8217;t willing to be questioned,&#8221; said OpenOakland&#8217;s Steve Spiker. &#8220;But there is a love for this city that&#8217;s very strong and very rich, and it&#8217;s got a history of social activism that&#8217;s carried over in a lot of ways to the tech community.&#8221;

## 2012 &#8211; OpenOakland starts up

[**City Hall starts its Open Gov, Open Data journey with City Camp Oakland**](http://archive.oaklandlocal.com/posts/2013/01/1-16-opening-government-oakland%E2%80%99s-first-citycamp-community-voices)  
_December 6, 2012 &#8211; Oakland Local, Howard Dyckoff_  
Steve Spiker: &#8220;CityCamp Oakland was about supporting open government and we all witnessed some genuine interest in seeing this happen from city staff with a real desire to partner with us and others to make this happen. Our team put a ton of effort into creating an event to show appreciation to our city staff and to create a safe, encouraging place for us all to have open, frank conversations about how we can all collaborate to make our city even greater, for all our residents, not just the tech community.&#8221;

[**OpenOakland brigade encourages collaboration between government and community using technology**](http://oaklandnorth.net/2012/12/03/openoakland-brigade-encourages-collaboration-between-government-and-community-using-technology/)  
_December 3, 2012 &#8211; SFGate.com / Oakland North, Nausheen Husain_  
Over 120 people, including programmers, city officials, bloggers and community members, attended Saturday’s [CityCamp] “unconference,” or interactive forum with topics of discussion that attendees themselves chose.

[**Data community asks Oakland Council candidates to sign &#8216;open government&#8217; pledge**](http://oaklandlocal.com/article/115-data-community-asks-oakland-council-candidates-sign-open-government-pledge)  
_November 4, 2012 &#8211; Oakland Local, Barbara Grady_  
[OpenOakland] asked City Council and City Attorney candidates to sign a pledge of open government principles including transparency, participation and collaboration.

**[Oaklanders push City Council candidates for increased government transparency](http://blog.sfgate.com/inoakland/2012/11/02/oaklanders-push-city-council-candidates-for-increased-government-transparency/)**  
 _11/2/12 &#8211; SFGate.com / Oakland North, Nausheen Husain_  
Born out of [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/), a non-profit that serves as a kind of digital liaison between governments and residents, OpenOakland is a group of volunteers interested in using technology to make government more accessible.

**[A Crowdsourced Hyperlocal City Guide, Coming To You Soon](http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680760/a-crowdsourced-hyperlocal-city-guide-coming-to-you-soon)**  
_10/24/12 &#8211; Fast Company: Co.Exist, Emily Badger_  
Thanks to a grant from the [Knight News Challenge](http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/20094016/), LocalWiki has been further developing the software so that communities anywhere can replicate the idea. The Raleigh-Durham Triangle area launched one earlier this year. Now [Oakland](http://oaklandwiki.org/) and [Ann Arbor](http://arborwiki.org/) have wikis, too. As a sign of true global dominance, a LocalWiki project is even coming to [Antarctica](http://localwiki.org/blog/2012/oct/10/localwiki-antarctica/).

**[Meet Our Vanguard: Stephen Spiker](http://americancity.org/daily/entry/meet-our-vanguard-stephen-spiker)**  
_10/8/12 &#8211; Next American City, Kate Holmquist_  
Stephen Spiker is brigade co-captain for the new start-up OpenOakland, a volunteer group of hackers, software engineers and civic advocates who build open source technology to tackle civic issues that government doesn’t have the resources to undertake. Spiker loves data, democracy and design. Oh, and he’s a new dad, too.

**[OpenOakland Brigade tries to unite techies, community advocates and city hall

The Brigade project started as a way to create a national network of cities whose residents were leveraging technology to improve their community. The Gov 2.0 civic tech movement is a growing one but tools developed in one city were being reinvented in others.
