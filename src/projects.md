    Every 2 years the city of Oakland releases a budget in a spreadsheet that has nearly 20,000 rows, which does not make for ideal reading. The mission of Open Budget Oakland is to transform this mountain of data into an interactive display of charts and diagrams that is easy and even fun to use. Our MVP is live, but could benefit from improvements and new features.

  </h3>
  
  <div class="col1">
    <strong>Established</strong>: 2011
  </div>
  
  <div class="col2">
    Adopt a Drain is a platform for Oakland residents to volunteer to be responsible for keeping a nearby storm drain clear to decrease flooding from storms, protect water quality, and keep trash from storm drains and connected creeks and water bodies. Vigilant maintenance of the City’s storm drain infrastructure is important for reducing pollution in the Bay. Adopt a Drain was set up in partnership with <a href="http://www2.oaklandnet.com/government/o/PWA/o/FE/s/ID/OAK024735#Drain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Oakland’s Public Works Agency</a>.

  <div class="col1">
    <strong>Established</strong>: 2017 <strong>Team Contact</strong>: Angela Gennino and Richard Ng on Slack channel <a href="https://openoakland.slack.com/messages/C67FNRY20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#cannabis_equity</a>
  </div>
  
  <div class="col2">
    <strong>Our Backstory</strong>: The City of Oakland is in the process of expanding their medical cannabis licensing to include regulation for cultivation and manufacturing. As part of this activity, the City also codified an Equity Licensing Program to address barriers to participation in the industry for members of disenfranchised communities in Oakland. This program includes a provision for “equity business incubators” to support new businesses in the industry. Equity businesses in the pipeline will be important to regular applicants, because regular licenses will only be issued on a one-to-one basis with equity licenses during the initial phase of the program. The incubator opportunity is intended to help new enterprises overcome the barrier of securing commercial space by incentivizing more established businesses to agree to share their existing space for a minimum of three years. By partnering with an equity business, a regular applicant will be moved to the top of the list for the next available non-equity cannabis business license.
  <br />
    
    To support the Equity Licensing Program, OpenOakland is providing support to other volunteer technologists and cannabis entrepreneurs who are working with the City of Oakland’s City Administrator’s Office and the Department ofRace and Equity to develop <a href="http://cannaequity.org/">CannaEquity.org</a>, an online“matchmaking” application that would assist interested equity and regularapplicants to locate each other efficiently. Applicants would create onlineaccounts to pre-screen for compatibility and control the pace of informationsharing and relationship building needed for the formation of space-sharingrelationships. Once built, the app will be maintained until the end of phaseone of licensing. This date will be determined by the collection of cannabistax revenue sufficient to launch the next phase of equity applicant supportservices (assumed to be within one year).

  <div class="col2">
    <strong>Our Backstory</strong>: The fifth annual CityCamp successfully took place on Saturday, March 25, 2017 at Oakland City Hall. CityCamp is an unstructured conference where municipal employees, civic leaders, technology folks, software developers, journalists, and engaged residents can meet and discuss the intersections of technology and local government—how innovative technology and data uses can improve civic engagement, increase efficiency and transparency, connect residents, and incubate the technology community in our city. Unconferences are not structured up-front; the agenda is completed on the day based on topics the attendees themselves suggest. This gives attendees control over the topics and discussion happening at the event, so residents can drive attention towards issues they think are most important.

  <div class="col2">
    <strong>Our Backstory</strong>: Beginning for Oakland's 2012 elections, we asked electoral candidates to take the <a href="http://oaklandcandidates.org/OpenGovPledge2012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Government Pledge</a> to support the following principles of Open Government:
    
    <ul>
      <li>

<!-- AL removed link to ordinance -->
  <div class="col2">
    <strong>Our Backstory</strong>: Soft Story is a simple interactive map of potential soft-story buildings in Oakland. Soft-story buildings are multi-unit, wood-frame, residential buildings with a first story that lacks adequate strength or stiffness to prevent leaning or collapse in an earthquake. These buildings pose a safety risk to tenants and occupants, a financial risk to owners, and risk the recovery of the city and region. This data shows the results of a screening program for potential soft-story buildings in Oakland. In 2008 Oakland surveyed its multi-family buildings with five or more units, and in 2009 passed an ordinance that required the owners of these buildings to complete a simple evaluation of the ground floor. This data shows the results of these screenings as of early 2013.

    <strong>Our Backstory</strong>: While gang signs and other graffiti are common to inner cities, East Oakland is suffering from a plague of illegal dumping—mostly from outside actors. Trash Talk is envisioned as a tool for help neighbors plan and execute cleanups and graffiti removal.The app will help neighbors report issues and work together with the Oakland City Public Works Agency to remove trash, dead animals, and other consequences of illegal dumping in East Oakland neighborhoods.
