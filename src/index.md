### OpenOakland bridges **technology** and **community** for a thriving and equitable Oakland.

As part of the [Code for America Brigade network](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org), we are a welcoming and inclusive volunteer group of developers, designers, data geeks, and citizen activists who use creative technology to solve civic and social problems.
